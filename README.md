## Sharding data 
# Introduction
This project implements data sharding in a Spring Boot application with a MySQL backend to improve scalability, performance, and manageability of large datasets. By distributing data across multiple database shards, the system can handle high traffic and large amounts of data while maintaining efficiency.

The project leverages Spring Boot for rapid development, MySQL for reliable data storage, and tools like Sharding-JDBC for seamless sharding implementation. It demonstrates key principles of distributed database architecture, including query routing, shard management, and scalability strategies.
