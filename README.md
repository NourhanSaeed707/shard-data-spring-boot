# Sharding data 
## Introduction
This project implements data sharding in a Spring Boot application with a MySQL backend to improve scalability, performance, and manageability of large datasets. By distributing data across multiple database shards, the system can handle high traffic and large amounts of data while maintaining efficiency.

The project leverages Spring Boot for rapid development, MySQL for reliable data storage, and tools like Sharding-JDBC for seamless sharding implementation. It demonstrates key principles of distributed database architecture, including query routing, shard management, and scalability strategies.

## Features
1- Data Sharding Strategy:
Supports both range-based and hash-based sharding for flexible data distribution.
Allows custom sharding keys, such as user ID or order ID, to divide data across shards.

2- Dynamic DataSource Routing:
Routes database queries to the correct shard dynamically based on the sharding key.
Uses AbstractRoutingDataSource or Sharding-JDBC for automatic query routing.

3- Scalability:
Enables horizontal scaling by adding more database shards as data volume grows.
Facilitates scaling out databases without downtime.
Read-Write Splitting:

Integrates with a master-slave architecture for further performance optimization.
Directs read queries to replicas and write queries to primary shards.

4- High Availability:
Supports failover mechanisms and database redundancy to ensure system reliability.
Leverages MySQL Cluster or replication for fault tolerance.

5- Sharding Configuration Management:
Centralized configuration using application.yml or application.properties.
Allows easy adjustment of sharding rules and shard mappings.

6- Customizable Sharding Rules:
Provides flexibility to define custom sharding algorithms for complex use cases.
Example: Assigning users to shards based on geographic region or user group.

7- Distributed Transactions:
Handles transactions across multiple shards using two-phase commit (2PC) or SAGA patterns.
Ensures data consistency in distributed environments.

8- Performance Optimization:
Reduces database load by splitting data into smaller, manageable shards.
Minimizes query latency and improves overall response time.

9- Developer Productivity:
Simplifies shard management with tools like Sharding-JDBC.
Seamlessly integrates with Spring Bootâ€™s ecosystem, including Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.

10- Monitoring and Management:
Tools like Grafana or Prometheus can be integrated for shard health monitoring.
Provides insights into shard utilization and query performance.
